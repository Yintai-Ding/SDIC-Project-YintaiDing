## Introduction

----------

This repository is used as a backup on Github for [Yintai Ding](https://github.com/Yintai-Ding/SDIC-Project-YintaiDing)'s postgraduate individual project. The full name of the project is **'Partial Ionisation Cross Sections MSc Project'** and the belongs to **Unversity College London, MSc Scientific and Data Intensive Computing**. This project is supervised by Prof. Jonathan Tennyson and Dr. Bridgette Copper.

This project has two main components. The first is obtain mass spectrum data from the [NIST chemical web book](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) and the second part is to design a user friendly graphical interface to interact with the database. The first part is completed by Lifeng Luo and the second is maintained by Yintai Ding. 

## Instructions for Usage

--------------

There is a zip which name is'**data-20.zip**' which users should decompress to find the database. Remember to move the '**data-20.db**' file to the folder '**SDIC Project**' or users could change file path in the program manually. 

Within the '**SDIC Project**' folder there are two subfolder '**elements**' and '**geometries**'. These folders contains information for elements and relative position for atoms in sample molecules which are necessary to check the validation of data in the database. The '**fragments_generation.py**' contains functions help checking the validation of data. If the users wants to check the validation of the data in the provided database, they could run the file '**test_case.py**' by: 

```Bash
$ python test_cases.py
```

The first row of this code will show the users the intersection of the data generated by theoritical functions and the data gathered by mass spectrum. The second and the third will provide the difference of two methods. These will help users to check if any fragment is not reasonable to be negelected by mass spectrum.

There are three ui files 'Options.ui', 'brief sample.ui' and 'show_fragments.ui' which is generated by QtDesigner. If users wants to reedit the ui outlook please load the file in QtDesigner or open the related py file and edit them directly. 

The main interface is in the '**brief sample.py**'. To open the interface, please open the file in your python compiler and run the code

![main_UI]

As shown above, users could choose their input of molecule as '*name*', '*cas number*' and '*formula*'. After ticking the "*Calculate branching ratio for all possible fragments*" users could click the '*Run*' button to show the result of fragments. Here we use '*Methane*' as a sample: 

![show_fragments]
Here we could check the possible fragments for different charge_mass ratios and their corresponding branching ratios. These data is gathered from the NIST webpage with the electron energy to be 80eV. 

If users have experimental data which might be more accurate and want to upload to the database, they could clicked on the '*Options*' button and input the data manually.

![options]

In this interface, users should input the electron energy level in the first line edit first. To input the experimental data, they should fill the elements row by row. If some data like '*cas number*' is missing, please just ignore and leave it empty. If several rows need to be recorded simultaneously, users could click the button '*Add Row*' and click '*Remove Row*' if some data is not needed. Remember to click the button '***Update***' before submit your data. When a message box 'input comfirmed!' is shown on screen, it means the input in recorded by the database.
